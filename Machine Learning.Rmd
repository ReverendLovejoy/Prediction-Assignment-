__Steps taken:__
```{R, include=FALSE}
library(caret); library(randomForest); library(parallel); library(doParallel)
cluster <- makeCluster(detectCores() - 1)
registerDoParallel(cluster)
pmlTraining <- read.csv("/Users/michaelruan/Documents/R/Practical Machine Learning/pml-training.csv")
pmlTesting <- read.csv("/Users/michaelruan/Documents/R/Practical Machine Learning/pml-testing.csv")
```

__1. Remove columns largely populated with NAs__
```{R}
pmlTraining2 <- pmlTraining[,-c(1:6, 12:36, 50:59, 69:83, 87:101, 103:112, 125:139, 141:150)]
```

__2. Partition training dataset into two separate datasets, Training and Validation__
```{R}
inTrain = createDataPartition(pmlTraining2$classe, p = .7, list=FALSE)
training <- pmlTraining2[inTrain,]; validation <- pmlTraining2[-inTrain,]
```

__3. Train random forest model with 10-fold cross-validation__
```{R}
fitControl <- trainControl(method = "cv",number = 10, allowParallel = TRUE)
fit <- train(classe~., method="rf",data=training,trControl = fitControl)
stopCluster(cluster)
```

__4. Use model to predict on validation set, obtained an accuracy of 99.69%. This was the highest of any model used, so it was retained for use on the Testing set__
```{R}
predictionTrain <- predict(fit, newdata=validation)
accuracy <- sum(predictionTrain==validation$classe)/length(validation$classe)
print(accuracy)
```
```{R, echo=FALSE}
table(predictionTrain, validation$classe)
```

__6. The accuracy on the Testing set was 20/20__

```{r}
answers <- predict(fit, pmlTesting)
print(answers)
````
